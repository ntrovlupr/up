          This is about my jouney into web design & development that began in 2000 where I had just learned my  <a href="#" data-tool-tip="HTML is a markup language that web browsers use to interpret and compose text, images, and other material into visual or audible web pages."> basics in HTML</a> and one JavaScript function, a counter. In 2007 I started learning CSS and more HTML.
          I wanted to make this a hobby that might lead to something more.

              This is about my jouney into web development. I had been chasing after it since about 2000. I began studying my very, very fundamentals in <a href="#" data-tool-tip="HTML is a markup language that web browsers use to interpret and compose text, images, and other material into visual or audible web pages."> HTML</a>. I played around with it trying to build pages using tables but after a few years I was off doing something else. I went to culinary school from 2003- 2005 and then in 2007 I started learning CSS and more HTML. I was looking for something that may help me provide for my family in a real way. I decided to up my skill set and make myself more valuable so in 2017 I began learning full time by dedicated all my free time to learning the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and MySQL. I just went for it, had fun, and soaked up as much as I could.
